# Zakura wallet libraries

The wallet layer of the Zakura stack: the librustzcash crates a wallet needs
that [`zakura-core/libraries`](https://github.com/zakura-core/libraries) does
not already ship, forked and rewired onto the published `zakura-*` crypto
crates.

`libraries` covers the proving stack and the crates that sit directly on top of
it — `zakura-primitives`, `zakura-keys`, `zakura-proofs`, `zakura-orchard`, the
halo2 family. It stops below the wallet layer, so a wallet consuming it still
resolves `zcash_client_backend` and `zcash_client_sqlite` from crates.io, which
drags the crates.io `orchard` and `zcash_primitives` back into the graph
alongside their Zakura forks. This repository closes that gap.

## What is vendored

| Directory | Published as | Forked from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `librustzcash/pczt` | `zakura-pczt` | `zcash/librustzcash` |
| `librustzcash/zcash_client_backend` | `zakura-client-backend` | `zcash/librustzcash` |
| `librustzcash/zcash_client_sqlite` | `zakura-client-sqlite` | `zcash/librustzcash` |

Directory names and library target names keep their upstream spelling, so crate
sources and `use` paths are untouched; only the package name changes. This is
the convention `libraries` already follows.

**Membership rule.** A crate belongs here when it depends on the renamed crypto
stack and `libraries` does not already ship it. A crate that `zakura-*` resolves
from crates.io must *not* be vendored here — two copies of a package whose types
cross the boundary are two different types, and the build only fails later, in a
consumer. `zcash_address`, `zip321`, `zcash_protocol`, `zcash_transparent`,
`zcash_encoding` and `equihash` therefore stay on crates.io.

`zcash_client_sqlite` upstream also depends on `zcash_pool_migration`. Vizor
does not use the pool-migration engine, so this fork cuts that dependency
instead of carrying the crate. The ZIP 318 classification and send policy built
around the engine are removed too. A forward migration drops the schema they
left behind, so an existing database still opens. Anchor retention stays,
because Vizor's own migration depends on it. See `docs/zip318_removal.md`.

## Layout

Three directories:

```text
librustzcash/   forked upstream crates   edited directly; upstream arrives as merges
wallet-lib/     the backend selector     hand-written
zakura/         new Zakura work          hand-written; includes Enhance PIR
```

The root `Cargo.toml` is generated; vendored Rust sources are edited directly
and maintained through vendor-branch merges. New crates belong in `wallet-lib/`
or `zakura/` and are listed in `layout.extra_members` in
`manifests/sources.toml`. Checked-in protobuf bindings have an explicit
regeneration command, separate from ordinary builds.

## How the rewiring works

Nothing is patched at the source level. `manifests/sources.toml` holds a
`[rewire]` table, and the generated root `Cargo.toml` turns each entry into a
Cargo dependency rename:

```toml
orchard = { version = "2.0.0", package = "zakura-orchard" }
```

The dependency key stays `orchard`, so every `orchard::` path in the vendored
sources keeps compiling, while the package that satisfies it is the fork. The
vendored crates inherit these through `workspace = true`. The small source
patches in this repository expose NU7 through the wallet APIs and remove the
obsolete ZIP 233 feature that Common no longer provides.

Package names differ from their upstream originals, so consumers declare these
crates directly and every edge is explicit — the same reasoning `libraries`
documents. The one `[patch.crates-io]` table, taken from `[patch.crates-io]` in
`manifests/sources.toml`, replaces every crate published from Common with a
pinned revision that uses the stable `bip32 0.6` / `secp256k1 0.33` /
`zcash_script 0.6` stack. The published Common v2.0.0 crates require
`bip32 0.6.0-pre.1`, which cannot share a lockfile with the upstream LRZ
backend of the facade.

## Development

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for focused checks, build ownership,
explicit protobuf generation, and final validation. Agent guidance lives in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Verify

```bash
./scripts/verify-zakura-graph.sh
```

Checks the workspace with all targets and all features, then reads
`cargo metadata` to prove the resolved graph is Zakura-only: no crates.io
original of a forked crate is present, and no vendored crate appears twice.
Compiling alone would not prove this — an edge that escapes the rewiring builds
fine here and fails later where the two type families meet.

## Selecting a backend

`wallet-lib/` holds `zakura-wallet-lib`, which exists for code that has to build
for **both** Gemini and Vizor from one source tree — `zcash_voting` and the vote
commitment tree. It re-exports one family under stable names:

```rust
use zakura_wallet_lib::{client_backend, orchard};
```

```toml
# Vizor: complete Zakura capability set, the default
zakura-wallet-lib = "0.1.0-rc6"

# Gemini: equivalent upstream LRZ capability set
zakura-wallet-lib = { version = "0.1.0-rc6", default-features = false, features = ["lrz"] }
```

The two features are mutually exclusive. Cargo features are additive and there
is no way to enable a dependency when a feature is *off*, so the upstream
family needs its own named feature rather than being the implicit
`not(zakura)` case. Because `zakura` is the default, selecting `lrz` requires
`default-features = false`. Enabling both, or neither, is a compile error.

`scripts/verify-wallet-lib-modes.sh` builds it each way and fails if a crate from
the other family appears, if disabled packages leak into an external
consumer's lockfile or Cargo metadata, or if the mutually-exclusive rules stop
holding. `zakura` and `lrz` are the only feature flags; each enables Orchard
and the complete capability set required by `zcash_voting`.

An end consumer that builds for exactly one stack does not need this crate at
all — it declares the packages it wants directly, as below.

## Consume from a wallet

The dependency keys keep their upstream names, so wallet source needs no changes:

```toml
zcash_client_backend = { version = "0.1.0-rc7", package = "zakura-client-backend" }
zcash_client_sqlite = { version = "0.1.0-rc7", package = "zakura-client-sqlite" }
pczt = { version = "0.1.0-rc4", package = "zakura-pczt" }
```

The crypto stack comes from crates.io as `zakura-*`; do not also declare the
upstream crates. Until Common publishes the stable transparent stack, a
consumer must also declare the `[patch.crates-io]` table from
`manifests/sources.toml`.

## Working on the fork

`librustzcash/` is ours to change. Edit the files, commit, done — there is no
regeneration step and no patch series to keep in sync.

Upstream arrives as a merge. `vendor/librustzcash` is a branch holding pristine
upstream, pruned to the crates we vendor, with their directories at its root.
Moving to a new release updates that branch and merges it here:

```bash
./scripts/sync-upstream.sh                    # re-check the pinned release
./scripts/sync-upstream.sh <tag-or-commit>    # move to a new release
```

Because the vendor branch is unmodified upstream, the merge base is a real
upstream tree and git can tell our changes from theirs. Conflicts happen — that
is what carrying real changes costs — and the script stops (exit status 2) and
leaves the merge in place rather than guessing. Finish it, then re-run the
verification scripts. The scheduled sync job commits that conflicted merge onto
the automation branch and opens a **draft** pull request instead of failing
silently.

The root `Cargo.toml` stays generated, from the upstream workspace manifest the
vendor branch carries as `librustzcash/upstream-workspace.toml`. That is what
keeps the dependency rewiring out of merge territory: upstream bumps versions
on the same lines our renames touch, and generating the file means the two
never meet.

CI checks provenance rather than regenerating — the vendor commit recorded in
`manifests/sources.toml` must be an ancestor of `HEAD` — so a change pasted
into `librustzcash/` without a merge fails the build.

Not every upstream tag is consumable. Release candidates are cut before their
sibling crates are published, and upstream builds them against in-repo paths,
so a tag can call an API that does not exist in the crates.io release we
resolve. `zcash_client_sqlite-0.22.0-rc.8` is exactly that: it calls
`zcash_protocol::TxId::from_hex`, unpublished at the time of writing, so the
pin stays at `-rc.7`. The verification scripts are the gate; a sync that fails
them does not become a pull request.

## Automatic upstream updates

The **Sync upstream releases** workflow runs daily. It lists the upstream tags,
keeps those matching `tag_pattern` in `manifests/sources.toml` — the
`zcash_client_sqlite` release train, which is how `zcash_voting` selects its LRZ
version — and compares the highest semantic version against the current pin.
`allow_prerelease` decides whether a prerelease may be proposed automatically.

A newer release is synced, verified, and raised as a pull request on the
long-lived `automation/upstream-sync/librustzcash` branch. Nothing is
auto-merged. If the merge conflicts, verification is skipped and a **draft**
pull request is opened with the conflict markers committed, so someone can
check out the branch and finish the merge. A sync that merges cleanly but fails
verification still does not open a pull request. The same discovery runs
locally:

```bash
./scripts/discover-upstream-updates.py
```

Pull requests created with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger other
workflows, so a sync pull request shows no checks even though the sync job
verified the result before opening it. Setting an `UPSTREAM_SYNC_TOKEN` secret
that may open pull requests makes `verify.yml` run on the branch as well.
